I’m excited to announce [Coding Solo](https://codingsolo.works/), a new podcast by myself and [David Thorpe](https://twitter.com/davzie) about freelancing in the UK.

Our aim for Coding Solo is to discuss both the positive and negative aspects of freelancing (in our experience and that of others) as well as talk about some of the specific UK aspects of freelancing - from taxes to IR35 to finding work.

Today we released our first episode “Procrastination and Prime Day”. We introduce ourselves and lightly touch on some of the topics we want to cover in depth in later episodes. We finish up with a technical chat about protocol buffers and iOS development; two things we’re both learning about as part of our current gigs.

Please do send us any feedback you have especially if there any topics you feel we should cover or any questions you'd like us to answer about freelancing. You can email us at [feedback@codingsolo.works](mailto:feedback@codingsolo.works).
