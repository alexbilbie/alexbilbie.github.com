[David](https://twitter.com/davzie) and I are back with a new episode of our podcast about freelancing in the UK, [Coding Solo](https://codingsolo.works/).

In this episode we talk about setting up to go solo including setting up a limited company, find a bank that doesn't suck, discussing how expenses and dividends work, how much accountants generally cost and how to run your company from an expenditure perspective.

Please do send us any feedback you have especially if there any topics you feel we should cover or any questions you'd like us to answer about freelancing. You can email us at [feedback@codingsolo.works](mailto:feedback@codingsolo.works).
