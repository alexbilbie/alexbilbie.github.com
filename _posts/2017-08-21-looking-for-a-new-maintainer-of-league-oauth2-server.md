title: Looking for a new maintainer of league/oauth2-server
---


A little over five years ago I pushed the [first commit](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/commit/6649083e71dd7c1e095e8dd56df15f1adbc5b30c) for the project that eventually became [league/oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server).

The project has been downloaded over 2.5 million times, has more than 3000 Github stars and has been contributed to by 77 awesome people across some 2000 commits.

Last year when I became self-employed I had intentions that I’d have more time to dedicate towards open source projects but reality worked out slightly differently and I’ve one of the busiest (and best) years of my life.

The other principal factor is truth be told I don’t actively use the project any more. This past year I’ve become more of a programming language polyglot and I’ve written more lines of JavaScript, Swift and Go than I have PHP.

That the project has stagnated somewhat has started to bother me greatly. Therefore I believe it is now time to hand over the reigns to someone who can devote more time and energy to the project than I’ve been able to.

I’ve no deadline for finding someone - I want to find the right person (or group of people) who is/are really impassioned by the project, want to advance the project (for example implement OpenID support) and are willing to devote time to answering support requests and review pull requests.

If you reading this are that person, or you know someone who might be please email me - [hello@alexbilbie.com](mailto:hello@alexbilbie.com) - I’d love to have a chat with you.
