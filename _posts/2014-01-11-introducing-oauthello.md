So tonight [I announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexbilbie/status/422121924547063808) that I'm writing a book - [OAuthello, a book about OAuth](https://leanpub.com/oauthello-a-book-about-oauth/).

Why?

1. I've been helping Phil Sturgeon edit [his book](https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate) for the past few weeks and I've really enjoyed the process.
2. It's a personal challenge - I genuinely care about this subject and it motivates me.
3. I've written several 5000+ word reports before in my old job so I know I'm capable of putting words on paper.
4. Everyone else in the PHP community is writing a book so I may as well join in.

So here's my rough plan:

1. Publicly talk about the book so people will badger me about it and judge me if I don't finish it.
2. Get a few chapters done before I open the landing page up for sales.
3. Finish the book by April/May.
4. Talk about the whole process at [Croydon Tech City](http://croydontechcity.com/) once it's published.
