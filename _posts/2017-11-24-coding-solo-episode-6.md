In episode six of [Coding Solo](https://codingsolo.works/), I talked about yet another holiday, we talk about how our new video-based ventures are going, and how we validate those ideas we have in the shower (or crawling through the Cá»§ Chi tunnels).

Please do send us any feedback you have especially if there any topics you feel we should cover or any questions you'd like us to answer about freelancing. You can email us at [feedback@codingsolo.works](mailto:feedback@codingsolo.works).
